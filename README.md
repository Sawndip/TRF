Trans-dimensional random field language model
======================================
Here includes the source code of Trans-dimensional random field language model (TRFLM), and the scripts of experiment on several dataset, such PTB corpus.

Use `make all` to complie the code and the executables are generated in **bin/**

The package is organized as follows:
- **src/** includes the C++ source code
- **exp/** includes	the scripts and data of the language modeling experiments

For a detial introduction of TRFLM, see
